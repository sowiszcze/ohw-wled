# OHW-WLED - an OpenHardware project for a [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED) host PCB

This project aims to tackle an issue of mine, where I couldn't find a PCB design for ESP Î¼C hosting WLED that suited my needs:
- Take in 5V DC power and output 5V logic
- Allow the use of all WLED's hardware features (through DIY extensions/modules)
- Be an Open Source Hardware project

I'm not saying there is no project like that, I just wasn't able to find one. As I was making it, I thought sharing the design could benefit someone or even (crazy thought, I know!) improve somebody's life, hence this repository.

Please be considerate of the license this project is shared on.
